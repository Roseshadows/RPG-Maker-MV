# :sparkles: 你好呀！
- 👋 欢迎来到离影玫的小屋。
- 👀 我最近正在用*RPG Maker MV*为我自己制作一个游戏。不知道能不能坚持下来...:new_moon_with_face:
- 🌱 为了在我的游戏中实现一些有趣的功能，我正在努力钻研JavaScript，虽然现在才刚起步...(属于是一点代码的基础都没有，全部都得慢慢浸润)
- 💞️ 有个分支里存放着一些（可能就几个）我自己写的很菜很冗长的插件和意义不明的代码。随便去用就好，署不署名随意。（具体的使用条款可以在插件中找到）（好家伙，说得好像真的有人愿意用似的）
- 📫 呃，如果有人想跟我聊个天或是说些事儿，可以发邮件到Rose_shadows@163.com（不过我可能没法在短时间内回信）
# :sparkles: Hello!
- 👋 Welcome to @Roseshadows little house.
- Sorry for my odd English grammers and expressions as I'm not a native English speaker.
- 👀 I’m making efforts on creating my own game. The game engine is *RPG Maker MV*.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript to implement more interesting functions. And now I'm just a noob.
- 💞️ All of my plugins are free to use for both commercial and non-commercial projects. You can find them in another branch. Credits are appreciated, but not required.(The concrete Term of Use can be found inside plugins.) (As if someone would use them! lol)
- 📫 You can reach me at Rose_shadows@163.com if you have anything that you want to tell me, though I may not write back to you until a period of time later.
