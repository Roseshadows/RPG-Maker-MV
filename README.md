- 👋 Hi, I’m @Roseshadows . Here is the main storage used for store some important JSON or HTML files.
- Sorry for my odd English grammers and expressions as I'm not an English speaker.
- 👀 I’m making efforts on creating my own game. The game engine is RPG Maker MV.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript to implement more interesting functions. And now I'm just a noob.
- 💞️ All of my plugins are free to use commercially and non-commercially, as long as you give credit to me, Roseshadows.(As if someone would use them! lol)
- 📫 You can reach me at Rose_shadows@163.com if you have anything that you want to tell me, though I may not write back to you until a period of time later.
